The software development life cycle (SDLC) is the process of planning, writing, and modifying software. It encompasses a set of procedures, methods, and techniques used in software development.

- Importance:
- Understand your requirements and how you want your software to work
- Identify risks at an early stage
- Plan how you will deliver your solution in stages, such as building prototypes or writing functional specifications
- Be sure that each stage of development fits with what has gone before and what comes next.

- Stages of SDLC
 There are six stages of SDLC
 
 - Planning:
     efining objectives, scope and requirements of the system.
 - Analysis: 
     Studying the current system, gathering requirements, and identifying potential solutions.
 - Design:
     Developing a detailed plan for the system, including data flow diagrams, system diagrams, and other technical specifications.
 - Implementation: 
     Building the system according to the design.
 - Testing:
     Ensuring the system meets all requirements and functions properly.
 - Maintenance: 
     Updating, fixing, and optimizing the system as needed.
